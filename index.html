<!-- crafting User Interface:
    display both the playerâ€™s 
    boards and render them using
    information from the Gameboard class. 

     You need methods to render the gameboards
     and to take user input for attacking.
     For attacks, 
     let the user click on a coordinate
     in the enemy Gameboard.

     interface has a
     your grid display:
     that shows the players ships placed on the grid
     and later will have a drag and drop system

     and an opponets grid that doesn't show any ships
     until the player hits the ship or will display 
     a miss on that grid

     once a ship is hit the turn will stay as the
     players turn until they make another miss

     when oppnenet hits your grid miss will show up
     no your grid too and
     when a ship is hit it will turn red with an x on
     the section of the ship that was hit

     misses will turn grey with a black dot

     for testing there will be a section underneath 
     the players grids to show the computer's grids
     after testing hide that part of the display
     or remove it until needed again for testing.
