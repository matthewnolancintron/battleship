<!-- crafting User Interface:
    display both the player’s 
    boards and render them using
     information from the Gameboard class. 

     You need methods to render the gameboards
      and to take user input for attacking.
       For attacks, 
       let the user click on a coordinate
        in the enemy Gameboard.

        There are several options available 
        for letting users place their ships.
         You can let them type coordinates 
         for each ship, or investigate 
         implementing drag and drop.

         You can polish 
         the intelligence of
          the computer player by
           having it try adjacent
            slots after getting a ‘hit’.
